# HAND CALLENGE
this is an application that solves the problem from [hand-challenge](https://github.com/jesus-seijas-sp/hand-challenge)

## Instructions

This language works with a memory of an indefinite size of bytes, with all values initialized to 0. This language haves 7 instructions:

- ðŸ‘‰ : moves the memory pointer to the next cell
- ðŸ‘ˆ : moves the memory pointer to the previous cell
- ðŸ‘† : increment the memory cell at the current position
- ðŸ‘‡ : decreases the memory cell at the current position.
- ðŸ¤œ : if the memory cell at the current position is 0, jump just after the corresponding ðŸ¤›
- ðŸ¤› : if the memory cell at the current position is not 0, jump just after the corresponding ðŸ¤œ
- ðŸ‘Š : Display the current character represented by the ASCII code defined by the current position.
---
Notes
- As memory cells are bytes, from 0 to 255 value, if you decrease 0 you'll get 255, if you increment 255 you'll get 0.
- Loops of ðŸ¤œ and ðŸ¤› can be nested.
